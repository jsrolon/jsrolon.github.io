    <p>Hi, I'm a third year Systems and Computing Engineering undergraduate student at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.</p>

    <p>In this site you might find my writings, an incomplete list of which you can see on the right (go ahead and read if you so feel inclined); a little more about me in the corresponding page; a set of some of my technical and (perhaps) non-technical projects, and whatever else that I might find fitting.</p>
